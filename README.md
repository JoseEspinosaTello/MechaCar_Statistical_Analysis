## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

After examining the results of the multiple line linear regression model, we are able to see that of all the coefficients vehicle length and ground clearance are unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the intercept (mpg). The p-values of both vehicle length and ground clearance have a significance level much lower that the assume significance level of .05%, meaning they are statistically unlikely to create random amounts of variance to the linear regression model. In contrast the p-value of vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD all sit above the assumed significance level and are likely to create random amounts of variance.

With a p-value 5.35e-11 we state that the slope is not considered to be zero. Since the p-value is is lower thant he significace level of .05 we can say there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

This linear model does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively as it has a multiple R-squared value of .7149. This means that nearly 72% of variablility of mpg is explained in this linear model. Vehicle length and ground clearance have a higher correlation and significant impact on mpg, while, AWD, spoiler angle, and vehicle weight have a lower impact on mpg. and the 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

When gathering the summary statistics on the suspension coils we first gathered the statistics summary for the entire population.
