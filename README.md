## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

After examining the results, we are able to see that vehicle length and ground clearance are unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the intercept (mpg). The p-values of both vehicle length and ground clearance have a significance level much lower that the assume significance level of .05%, meaning they are statistically unlikely to create random amounts of variance to the linear regression model. In contrast vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD all sit above the assumed significance level and are likely to create random amounts of variance.

	• Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

	• Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

	• The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
